            Checked exceptions:
            -A checked exception must be explicitly declared in the method declaration, if a method throws it.
            -A checked exception must be caught in a try-catch block.

            Unchecked exceptions:
            - An unchecked exception does not need to be declared and does not need to be caught.
            -In Java, the only unchecked exceptions are RuntimeException and Error and their subclasses

    CheckPoints12_11-->
     -You use the throw statement in the method to throw an exception.
     -You cannot throw multiple exceptions in a single throw statement

      CheckPoints12_12-->
      -throw : is for throwing exception
      -throws : is for claiming exception
