       Which of the following classes defines a legal abstract class?
        -e,f

    CheckPoints13_02-->
        The getArea() and getPerimeter() methods may be removed from the
        GeometricObject class. What are the benefits of defining getArea() and
        getPerimeter() as abstract methods in the GeometricObject class?

            -->these methods are common value.With doing methods abstract
            you make confirmation to implement that abstract method.
            - A variable of GeometricObject type can use the getArea and getPerimeter methods at compilation time.

     CheckPoints13_03 -->
        a. An abstract class can be used just like a nonabstract class except that you cannot
        use the new operator to create an instance from the abstract class. true
        b. An abstract class can be extended.                                true
        c. A subclass of a nonabstract superclass cannot be abstract.       false
        d. A subclass cannot override a concrete method in a superclass to define it as abstract. false
        e. An abstract method must be nonstatic.  true
