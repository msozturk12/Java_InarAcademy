    Give an example to show why interfaces are preferred over abstract classes.
        it contains common quality over classes
        -A class can implement multiple interfaces, but it can only extend one superclass.

        Define the terms abstract classes and interfaces. What are the similarities and differences
        between abstract classes and interfaces?

        Abstract clasess: Are contains abstract methods that must be declared in realted class
        Interface: using -able for name,no new,...
           -you can not create class from both of them
            -In interface all data field name must be public static final int....
            -also in interface methods must be public abstract

            a. An interface is compiled into a separate bytecode file.   true
            b. An interface can have static methods.                     true
            c. An interface can extend one or more interfaces.           true
            d. An interface can extend an abstract class.                false
            e. An abstract class can extend an interface.                yes
